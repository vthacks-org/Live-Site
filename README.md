[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6ad1a547-3547-42e1-81f7-ce957bb2c23e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vt-hacks-live-site/deploys)

The Production Live Site can be found [here](https://vt-hacks-live-site.netlify.app/)

Later We will provide instructions on how to use the Netlify CMS to population the Live Site with information.

The Live Site is the website that we will be directing Hackers to on the day of the event

If you have any questions about the Live-Site, please contact anyone on the Web Dev team or Peter or Patrick

We hope you like it! - Jacob, Brian

## How to use the Netlify CMS to populate data on the Live Site

1. **Navigate to /admin on the Live Site!**
   Sign in with [github](https://github.com). If you aren't in the vthacks-org organization on github you'll have to request access.

2. **Browse Collections!**
   Select the collection you'd like to edit

3. **Create a new Item!**
   Or if you'd rather, edit an item
4. **Toggle Display on or off!**
   All items have the ability to be created, but not display themselves on the LiveSite. If you want to create info, but not have it yet displayed, make sure you disable the display toggle (It is turned on by default)

5. **Publish Changes!**
   Publishing your changes will tell netlify to deploy the website with the new information that was provided. The build and deploy process takes about 1 - 2 minutes

## How to start the development server

**Navigate to `/Live-Site`** Run `npm start`
