Participants will learn the basics of brainstorming an idea, forming a team, and the steps necessary to turn their ideas into prototypes. And above all else, how to get the most enjoyment from the hackathon experience!\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t"
