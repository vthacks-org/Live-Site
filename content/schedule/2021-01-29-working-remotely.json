  "description": "An overview of the timeline of our hackathon, the steps hackers should take to submit a project on time, an outline of how to work as a team remotely, and best practices from a judge's perspective. Participants will learn the basics of brainstorming an idea, forming a team, and the steps necessary to turn their ideas into prototypes. And above all else, how to get the most enjoyment from the hackathon experience!\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t",
