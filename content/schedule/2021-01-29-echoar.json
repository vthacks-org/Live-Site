Workshop participants will learn how to create real-time cloud-connected AR/VR apps using the echoAR platform. Participants will also discover how AR/VR are changing the world through the demonstration of different use cases of 3D applications and live demos of AR/VR experiences. Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop and a smartphone. Platforms for experimentation include: Google ARCore, WebXR, Vuforia, Unity-based apps, and more."
